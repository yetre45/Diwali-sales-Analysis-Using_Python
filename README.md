The festival of lights has a profound impact on consumer behavior, and through data analysis, I've unraveled patterns, trends, and correlations that can guide decision-making processes. using python (Jupyter Notebook) and built in libraries(Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn).

Project Description :- Performed Data Cleaning and Data Manipulation. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn Libraries. Improved Customer experience by identifying potential customers across different states, occupation, gender and age groups. Improved sales by identifying most selling product categories and products, which can help to plan inventory and hence meet the demands.
